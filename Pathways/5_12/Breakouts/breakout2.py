# Dispersion Analysis - Breakout Room Exercise
# ===========================================
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# In this exercise, you will analyze weather data variability using different
# measures of dispersion and detect potential weather anomalies.
# 
# Your tasks:
# 1. Calculate various dispersion measures (range, variance, standard deviation, IQR)
# 2. Identify and discuss months/seasons with high/low variability
# 3. Detect potential weather anomalies using IQR and Z-score methods
# 4. Create visualizations to represent your findings
# 5. Interpret your results and prepare to present them to the class
#
# Remember to consider:
#   - Which weather variables show the most/least variability
#   - How different seasons compare in terms of weather variability
#   - Which outlier detection method worked better for your data and why

# TODO: Create a DataFrame for each dataset
# Example: temp_df = pd.DataFrame(monthly_temps)
# precipitation_df = pd.DataFrame(monthly_precip)


# TODO: Calculate basic dispersion measures for each month's temperature
# For each month, calculate:
# - Range
# - Variance
# - Standard deviation
# - Interquartile range (IQR)


# TODO: Create a summary table of all dispersion measures for temperature
# Format it to 2 decimal places for readability


# TODO: Calculate the same dispersion measures for precipitation data


# TODO: Create a summary table for precipitation


# TODO: Visualize the dispersion of temperature data
# Hint: Box plots are great for showing dispersion and potential outliers


# TODO: Visualize the dispersion of precipitation data
# Consider using both box plots and histograms


# TODO: Detect temperature outliers using the IQR method
# For each month, determine which temperatures are outliers
# Remember: Outliers are typically defined as values that fall below Q1 - 1.5*IQR 
# or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR


# TODO: Detect temperature outliers using the Z-score method
# For each month, calculate Z-scores and identify outliers
# Typically, values with |Z| > 3 are considered outliers


# TODO: Compare the outliers detected by each method
# Do both methods identify the same outliers? If not, why might that be?


# TODO: Based on your analysis, determine:
# 1. Which month shows the highest temperature variability and why?
# 2. Which month shows the highest precipitation variability and why?
# 3. Is there a relationship between the variability of temperature and precipitation?
# 4. Which outlier detection method seems more appropriate for this weather data?


# PRESENTATION PREPARATION:
# Be ready to share:
# 1. Your summary tables of dispersion measures
# 2. Your visualizations showing the dispersion of both variables
# 3. The outliers you detected and which method you think worked better
# 4. Your interpretation of seasonal weather variability
