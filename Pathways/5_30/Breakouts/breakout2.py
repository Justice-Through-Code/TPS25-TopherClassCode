Tkinter Layout: Breakout Room 2 Worksheet
Advanced Layout Implementation

Instructions:
Work in your small groups to complete these tasks. Use the example code we've seen in class as a reference.
You have 25 minutes to complete this exercise.

TASK 1: Create a Contact Form with Grid Layout
- Create a window with the title "Contact Us Form"
- Use the grid layout manager to create a form with the following fields:
  * Name (Label + Entry)
  * Email (Label + Entry)
  * Subject (Label + Entry)
  * Message (Label + Text widget with multiple lines)
  * A Submit button

TASK 2: Make Your Form Responsive
- Make your form resize properly when the window is resized
- The text area for the message should expand when the window gets larger
- Use columnconfigure() and rowconfigure() with appropriate weight values
- Use sticky parameters to control how widgets expand

TASK 3: Organize with Frames
- Create a header frame at the top
- Put your form elements in a separate frame
- Add a footer frame at the bottom
- Style each section with different background colors

TASK 4: Apply Consistent Styling
- Use the same font for all labels
- Use the same size/padding for all entry fields
- Make the submit button stand out with color
- Add appropriate padding between elements

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS:
1. What challenges did you face when trying to make the form responsive?
2. How did using frames help organize your interface?
3. What would you do differently if you had to create a more complex form?

When finished, be prepared to share your screen and explain your layout decisions to the class.
