Tkinter Basics: Breakout Room 1 Worksheet
Building a Simple Application Interface

Instructions:
Work in your small groups to complete these tasks. Use the example code we've seen in class as a reference.
You have 25 minutes to complete this exercise.

TASK 1: Create a Basic Window
- Create a window with the title "Student Registration Form"
- Set the window size to 500x400 pixels
- Change the background color to a light color of your choice

TASK 2: Add and Configure Widgets
Add at least 5 different types of widgets to your window. Your interface should include:

1. A title label at the top with larger, bold font
2. At least two text entry fields with labels (for example: name, email)
3. At least one checkbox widget
4. A selection widget (either radio buttons or a dropdown)
5. A button to "submit" the form

TASK 3: Basic Widget Positioning
- Use either the pack() or grid() method to organize your widgets
- Add appropriate padding between widgets
- Make sure your interface looks clean and organized

BONUS CHALLENGE:
- Add a simple event handler for the submit button that displays the entered information

QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS:
1. What challenges did you encounter when positioning widgets?
2. How would you make this form more user-friendly?
3. What other widgets might be useful to add to a registration form?

When finished, be prepared to share your screen and explain your design decisions to the class.
