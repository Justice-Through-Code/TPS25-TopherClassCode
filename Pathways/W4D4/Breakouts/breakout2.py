# Instructions:
# Load your cleaned weather dataset from yesterday's session
# Create a multi-panel visualization with at least three subplots that together tell a meaningful story about your data
# Use different plot types for different aspects of the data:
# Consider time series, distributions, relationships between variables
# Use appropriate plot types for each (line, scatter, bar, histogram, etc.)
